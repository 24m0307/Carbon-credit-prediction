# 🌿 Carbon Credit Predictor

A simple and intuitive web application to estimate **carbon credits** based on key soil parameters using a machine learning model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This web application allows users—especially farmers, environmental scientists, and sustainability professionals—to input soil health indicators and receive a prediction for **carbon credits (Mg C/ha)**.

It is built using:

- **Flask** for backend development
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend form design
- **Scikit-learn / XGBoost / any ML model** (update this with your actual model) for carbon credit estimation

## ⚙️ Features

- User-friendly web interface
- Predicts carbon credits based on:
  - **Bulk Density (g/cm³)**
  - **Soil Moisture (%)**
  - **pH**
  - **Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)**
  - **Soil Organic Carbon Stock (SOC, Mg C/ha)**
- Dynamic rendering of results with Flask templating
